# Introduction

Every interviewer should, and probably will, ask you if you have any questions for them – always say yes. Asking questions shows that you have prepared for the interview and have an interest in the organization. Make sure that you bring your list of questions with you on a printed paper; do not expect to remember them on the spot and do not plan to look up a list on your phone. Be alert; be ready.

## A few simple rules

Rule #1: Always have questions ready to ask the interviewer.

Rule #2: If, during the interview, you have developed a good rapport and natural curiosity about the interviewer or something that the interviewer said, ask that question instead of a prepared one.

Rule #3: The best method is to ask your interviewer questions that give them a chance to talk about themselves. This helps you avoid asking questions about things that you could have easily learned from their website. It also demonstrates relationship-building skills and gives you a reason to be genuine. Luckily, asking questions about another person’s experiences or opinions comes naturally in conversation – don’t overthink it, be human.

Rule #4: Ask open-ended questions that elicit a response beyond “yes” or “no.”

Rule #5: This is not the time to ask questions about compensation, hours, perks, or titles. Asking such questions could potentially plant ideas about your motivations and drivers that may work against you. Instead, ask questions that are in the same context as the behavioral interview. This is your chance to find out if the organization’s values are just marketing buzzwords or truly a part of the culture.

## When NOT to ask questions

The only time you should forego the opportunity to ask a question is when you can tell that the interviewer is anxious to end the interview. Maybe the interviewer is running behind schedule and someone is waiting outside the room, or the next interviewer is waiting for their turn to meet with you. In these instances, be ready with a response like, “I have a few more questions, but I can send them to the recruiter. Thank you so much for your time.”

Ideally, you should have 4-5 questions ready. When being interviewed by more than one person sequentially, ask each interviewer a different question – they will compare the questions they were asked when they meet with each other to discuss your candidacy.

## Addressing a panel

If you are being interviewed by a panel, ask the panel at least two questions. In order to increase the possibility of having a different interviewer respond to your second question, make eye contact with someone other than the interviewer who responded to your first question. This is also a subtle way for you to demonstrate your ability to foster engagement from a group.
