# Introduction

Values-based questions openly examine whether or not your values are a good match with the organization’s values.

The good news is that the responses you’ve prepared for the “prior experience” questions can also work well for values-based questions. This is the time for you to refer to your list of the organization’s values from your homework.

Yes, you will want to use the organization’s lingo (can be found on their website and/or social media) in your responses as it shows an understanding of the organization and an ability to meld into their culture.

Please do not confuse this with being phony, it is not the same thing. Instead, you are simply placing your knowledge and experiences into a framework that is familiar to the interviewer.

Example
If one of the organization’s values is, “Act like an owner,” and you are sharing a time when you were responsible for something, you can describe it by saying, “I owned…”.

If the organization’s value is, “Continuous Improvement,” and you are giving an example of a problem you solved, it might fit to say something like, “this was a one-time fix for the problem, but in order to continuously improve, we monitored the results daily to understand early indicators.”

Sample answers
Q: Give me an example of an org culture where you felt like you could do your best work. What was it about the culture that allowed you to perform well?

When I was at ABC Foundation, there was a real focus on sharing information. We worked in teams of 8-10 people, each with a Lead. Leads reported up to managers that had two or three teams. The culture was very collaborative. Everybody worked on everything, so you got to know each other’s code and areas of expertise. If you discovered a new problem or way to do something, you were expected to add it to the KB. There was less reliance on tribal knowledge than there is at other places I’ve worked. There was no pressure to act like you know everything. If you had a question, you owned the question until it was answered, and then you were responsible for documenting the answer so others would have it. It wasn’t ok to just pose a question and be stuck if nobody responded. I got better at writing code other people could follow. My documentation really improved. We debated things and tested new ideas, but it wasn’t about something being right or winning an argument. It was about finding the best way to do something, which is really satisfying to me. If I were to join your company, I would hope to foster the same behaviors.

If you were an interviewer who was listening for certain values in this response, what would you hear?

When you’re a project manager, you have all of the accountability and none of the authority. You’re responsible for delivering work done by cross-functional teams and none of the resources report to you. It’s all about your ability to influence others. At both S Compnay and W Corp, projects required a sponsor or champion. This wasn’t just the person providing the budget. The project sponsor was an executive who was accountable for delivering the project. This person was on the hook for results as much as I was. The portfolio was prioritized rigorously, so we all knew which projects trumped others. Culturally, this created support for cross-functional teamwork and collaboration. This meant that someone who wasn’t your boss could have your back or be a champion for your work. The sponsor was an escalation point for negotiating tradeoffs. Sponsors were evaluated on their ability to deliver, and every leader had projects, so they were motivated to work with each other. There was a lot of communication about the status of active projects, which created transparency. It was easy to understand what work was important to the company, and you felt like you were contributing to all of it. There were lots of opportunities to build relationships with leaders across the organization and high perfomers were more visible. Sponsors listened to team members, asked for recommendations, and respected the people on the ground. I was empowered because there were lots of examples of leaders getting things done through influence rather than direct authority.
