# Practice: Answering Hypothetical Questions

Try your hand at answering these hypothetical questions!

Sample Questions
We have crafted some sample questions (below) for you to try your hand at. While you work on answering these questions, it is important to remember that you should be creative as well as practical. Stretch the limits of your reality, but not the bounds. Look through the questions and then click on the video widget to get started. Once you have finished answering each question, refer to the rubric to self-assess.

Your team is giving a presentation in two hours and one member just called in sick. What do you do?
If you had to choose between a work environment that was always in chaos and one in which nothing ever changed, which would you choose?
If you inherited so much money that you never had to work again, how would you spend your time?
If you could create a fictional company to make the world a better place, what would that company do?
Imagine that you are the product manager for a consumer device that just launched, but 20% of the devices are breaking in the first week from normal use. What do you do?

Remember: These questions may not necessarily follow the STAR technique because the situation is given and there are no tangible results that you can declare. Instead, restate the situation, be creative with your tasks and actions, and the results will be implied.
