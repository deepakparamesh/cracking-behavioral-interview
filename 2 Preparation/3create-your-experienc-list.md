# Exercise: Create a List of Experiences

In this lesson, brainstorm a list of examples that you will use to construct answers.

Now it’s time to think of stories from your own life that you can develop into rich and meaningful responses to behavioral questions.

What experiences do you know that you absolutely want to share? Imagine a movie is being made about your life and you get to choose the scenes that show you in the best possible light. What would you choose?

When you run out of ideas, use the prompts below to help you remember more examples. Consider:

- Times when you felt a huge sense of accomplishment or success.
- Times when you fixed something that wasn’t working.
- A time when you had to make a challenging decision.
- A time when you had to influence a leader or team.
- Times when you got surprised by something or had overlooked something.
- Times when you removed barriers or came up with a creative solution.
- A time when you failed but learned.
- A time when you had to defuse​ an escalating situation.
