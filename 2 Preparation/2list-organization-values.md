>📝 Note: Interviewers will listen for the words used in organizations’ values statements in your answers. Refer to this list as you practice answers to behavioral questions. If the organization’s values are consistent with your own, your answers are more likely to reflect that. If the organization’s values are inconsistent with your own, this may be a sign that their culture is not right for you.
