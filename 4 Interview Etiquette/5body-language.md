# Body Language

No matter what you say, or how you say it, your body can always give you away. Fortunately, our bodies are hackable. Read the list below and practice each action as you read.

Posture
Have good posture. This is an automatic signal of assurance and confidence. If you normally have bad posture, pretend that a string is pulling you up to the ceiling by the crown of your head. This works sitting or standing.

Eye contact
Look at the interviewer’s face, not just their eyes. While it is a belief that one should look directly into another’s eyes whilst talking, this can be unnerving for both you and the interviewer. In order to avoid this, try looking at a different part of the interviewer’s face every 2-4 seconds. This will keep you looking engaged and is significantly better than just glaring your eyeballs into theirs.

Hand gestures
Speak with your hands if you are unsure of what to do with them. It is human nature to hide your hands when you’re feeling nervous; however, doing so can communicate to the interviewer that you are hiding something. Even though the only thing you are hiding from them is probably your nervousness, such behavior can stand out and is best when avoided.

Think about the last time you watched the news, were the newscaster’s hands under the desk or clasped up on the desk? Most likely, their hands were above the desk because, on a biological level, it is much easier to trust someone you do not know if you can see that they’re not hiding something.

So, if you find yourself hiding your hands, use hand gestures as you talk – it will make it easier for the interviewer to trust you. On the other hand, if you have been told that you move your hands too much when you are talking, try clasping them together in front of you.

Walk
Work on your walk. When walking to meet an interviewer make sure that you’re walking directly toward them with every body part facing in their direction. Such body position shows you to be confident and ready to face challenges head on.
