# Learning from rejection

Rejection, is something that has happened to anyone who has ever applied for jobs. Sometimes, it is obvious that you’re going to get rejected, and sometimes it is not.

However, rejection is not something to get down about – it is only an indication that a job was not worthy of you. The most important thing to take away from a rejection is Do’s and Don’ts. Everyone’s Do’s and Don’ts will be different, and it is critical that you find yours. When you find yourself rejected, remember…

This is an opportunity for growth
You know you got rejected for a reason and it is your job to find out what that reason was. If you have the chance, ask the recruiter what indicated to them that you were not right for the job – there is no shame in asking and they may even respect you more for it. If, after asking this question, you get a response that doesn’t make sense to you and, in fact, seems like a lie – Don’t dwell on it. Sometimes, you won’t get a straight answer as to why you were rejected or even the right one. Why? Because sometimes an interviewer is having a bad day and you annoyed them, sometimes a company will have already decided on who they want and you were just unlucky enough to come in after them, and sometimes it will be even more arbitrary than that. The point is that sometimes rejections don’t make any sense at all.

If you don’t get feedback from the recruiter, do a self-assessment.

Review any queues you detected that you did not respond to an answer correctly.
Was there anything that you missed while doing your homework?

Pro Tip: Put yourself in your interviewer/recruiters shoes. Yes, the reason for your rejection may be phony, but it may be an attempt to maintain a relationship (if they have you in mind for another role)or let you down as easy as they possibly can. No matter the reason, it’s about THEM not YOU.

This job is not the only job in existence
After a rejection, quickly get back on that horse and find another opportunity. Since there are so many organizations looking for new talent, it is a good idea to be interviewing at multiple places at the same time; this way, one rejection won’t feel so devastating.

Never, ever, ever, personalize your rejection
Yes, the organization directly rejected you, but they also didn’t. There could be a variety of reasons you didn’t receive​ an offer (maybe they decided not to fill the job). For them, you were someone who was going to fill a role that they needed filled, not someone who they were looking to hangout with; so, it really wasn’t about you, it was about your skills. The good news is that, unlike your personality, skills are something you can grow and add to.

Rejection is normal
According to career coach and author Orville Pierson, “The average job seeker is rejected by 24 decision-makers before they get the yes”.

“You want to be extra rigorous about making the best possible thing you can. Find everything that’s wrong with it and fix it. Seek negative feedback, particularly from friends.” – Elon Musk

“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward​. So, you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” – Steve Jobs

Pro Tip: Every failure is actually a learning experience in disguise.
