# Simplify your look

In-person, patterned clothing can be a great way to individualize yourself but, on camera, patterns can be distracting and (potentially) blinding. Therefore, it is best to be outfitted in a solid colored shirt with minimal jewelry. Remember, this interview is about your skills, not your style; there’s no benefit to distracting your interviewer.

Pro Tip: Blue is the best color to wear on camera.

Be presentable
This rule is arguably the most important one in this list – you do not want to be caught on camera unawares. Luckily, most cameras have a preview functionality so you should easily be able to see if you are on camera. However, if you are worried, just put a sticky note over your computer’s camera until you’re ready. After all, you can never be too prepared!

Clarify your audio
Last, but not least, is your audio quality. Your interviewer needs to hear what you’re saying or else what is the point? If you are unsure of the quality of your audio, call a friend and talk to them, see what they think. If you recognize that you have bad audio an easy fix is to get a headset, which will clarify your voice and diminish any outside noise.

Additionally, try and drink a glass of water before you start; making sure that you’re hydrated will keep your voice smooth and decrease your chances of having to get up to get water in the middle of the interview.

Remember: Speak slower over devices than you would in person. Digital devices sometimes have a lag. Anytime there is something between you and another person, compensate by speaking slower.

Try it yourself!
Take a look at the pictures and mimic them in your own video. You have up to 2 minutes to record. Once you finish recording, analyze your videos with this rubric.
