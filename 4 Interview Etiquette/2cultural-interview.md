# Cultural Interview

In this lesson, we'll learn about the cultural interview.

The cultural interview is often a candidate’s first impression within a organization, so don’t take these interviews lightly. Although, typically, cultural interviews aren’t as terrifying as coding interviews, interviewers can make or break your application.

Most likely this interview will be run by a recruiter. They may, or may not, have development experience, but they should be able to have an intelligent conversation about front-end technologies.

It’s important to truly impress your recruiter because their opinion could have a massive impact on your application. If you make it to the second or third round of interviews, and the organization is “on-the-fence” about pushing you through, the recruiter might be your biggest advocate. So be sure to impress.

Typically, cultural interviews start with “So tell me about yourself.” It’s imperative to have a well-thought out response to this question. Let’s examine two responses:

You can see that Max was clearly unprepared for this question and doesn’t seem like the type of person who, when put on the spot, can eloquently handle the situation. With Paige, however, she is much more well-spoken. Not only was she able to succinctly sum up her experience, but her responses elicited emotion and pride in regards to her previous roles. Plus, throwing in a line or two about her hobbies gives insight into the type of person she is.
