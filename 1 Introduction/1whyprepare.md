# Why should you Prepare ?

Many job seekers underestimate the need to prepare for behavioral interviews. They assume it will be easy to talk about themselves and their experiences in a way that comes naturally without studying or refreshing beforehand. However, what you need to remember is that interviews can be stressful and stress produces negative side-effects like sweating, awkward body movements, and blank minds.

In such situations, our brains spend valuable processing time on keeping us calm and appearing professional, which means that there is less brain capacity for retrieving memories and stringing words together in an intelligent way.

Without enough preparation, candidates may end up rambling or sharing incoherent examples.
