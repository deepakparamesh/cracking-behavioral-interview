# Everyone is an interviewer

In this lesson, we'll explore why it is important that you treat everyone at the organization like an interviewer.

Use good manners! Being polite is consistent with being polished and professional. Elevate your speech to include regular use of please, thank you, you’re welcome, and excuse me. Say yes instead of yeah.

When someone asks, How are you?, reply with good eye contact, a smile, and a positive statement. Ask them how they are in return and make it genuine. If you know you have room for improvement here, ask someone in your life to help you practice this in advance of interviewing. Give them permission to tell you when you forget to say please and thank you. Don’t forget to thank them when they remind you!

## Anyone can have a say on your cultural fit

Remember, everyone you encounter, by phone or in-person, could be evaluating you as a candidate. This is especially true when an organization is looking at how well you fit into their culture.

When a decision is being made, you never know which interaction will tip the scales; anyone from recruiters to parking attendants could impact whether or not you’re hired.

Simply put, **be KIND to everyone**. Anyone in the organization can observe something you say or do and form an impression about how you would fit in. If the impression is compelling enough (no matter if it’s good or bad), they will find a way to share it with the hiring team.
